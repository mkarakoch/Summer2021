	  OOP Concept has 4 min rules in Java
	  
	  	1- Encapsulation 
	  		- Data Hiding 
	  		- By using "private" access modifier, we hide data
	  		- After hiding if you wantto read data from other classes ne need "getters"
	  		- After hiding if you wantto update we need setter 
	  		- To create objects from classes in Java we have many ways;
	  				+ A obj1 = new A() ; ==> fixed obj 
	  				
	  				+ A obj2 = new A( "Veli Han",13 ) ; 
	  				+ A obj3 = new A ( "Ayse Tan ", 23) ;
	  				
	  				+ A obj4 = new A ();
	  					obj4.setName("Ayse Tan");
	  					obj4.setAge(43);
	  					.
	  					.
	  					.
	  					obj4.setName("Mark Stone");
	  					obj4.setAge("27");
	  					
	  					
	  	
	  	2- Polimorphism : Overloading + Overriding 
	  	
	  	HW
	  	
	  	a)Overloading: ... same method name but different parameters---> this is overloading methods ?
	  						private things can be overloaded
	  						
	  	b) Overriding ... 
	  	
	  	
	  	c) What is the difference btw "Overloading" and "Overriding"?
	  			- Overloading does not need "inheritance", but inheritance is must for "Overriding"
	  			- private and static meths can be overloaded but cannot be overridden
	  			- Final methods can or canot be overloaded
	  			- Overloading happens in Compile Time, but Overriding happens in Run time
	  			- Overloading is faster than Overriding 
	  	
	  	
	  	
	  	3) Inheritance :... /
