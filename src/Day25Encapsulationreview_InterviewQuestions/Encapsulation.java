	/*
	  What is Encapsulation?
	  	- Reduce complexity, increase reusability 
	  	- it is a process to protect and hide the data
	  	- Preventing other classes from accessing directly the instance variable 
	  	- Data Hiding Process is called Encapsulation 
	  	- 
	 */
	
	/*
	 Ho do you hide data
	  - by uing private acces modifier 
	  
	  
	  
	  What is immutable class?
	  	- The class we cant update 
	  	- we use only getter method 
	  	- no need to create setter 
	  	- our variables should be private but not the class
	  	
	  	
	  What should be the data type for getter and setter 
	  	- setter ---> void 
	  	- getter --> int String double ... all but void 
	  	
	  	
	  	
	  What are the features of encapsulation?
	  
	  	- reusability 
	  	- flexibility
	  	- Maintenance
	  	- reduction of complexity
	  	- combine the data of our application and its manipulation  at one place
